In case we don’t know each other but you still found or got sent this document, my name is Carlos (pleased to meet you!). This document aims to achieve a number of goals:\n\n*Outline a personalized and intense learning plan towards my (relative) mastery of coding. It should be rich in deliberate practice and feedback, and adapt according to my growth and my mentors’ opinions. \n*Journal my progress to spot opportunities for improvement.\n*If you feel inclined to help me, this should make it easier for you to know how (or make it easier to pass along to people you think can help).\n\n(Thanks to my friend and mentor Stepan for his recommendation to put this together!)\n*TL;DR CARLOS’ STATUS\n*Currently at Semi-Sr. level, and looking for a new position as a full-stack developer after 2 years working for a small tech company based in Austin, TX.\n*Interested in solving a variety of new technical challenges that expose me to more problems, approaches and philosophies in programming.\n*Studying, practicing and building projects consistently to get really good at software engineering (see The Mission, The Approach, Resources).\n*Here is my website, Github (past 2 years of commits are private in my former employer’s profile), Linkedin and email.\n*\n\n*OUTLINE\n\n*How Did I Get Here?\n*The Vision\n*The Mission\n*Grow in Current or Different Job\n*Pursue Craftsmanship Effectively & Efficiently\n*Have More Ideas\n*Feel More Flow & Happiness\n*Grow Relationships & Alliances\n*The Approach\n*Learning, Practice and Credentials’ Progress\n*Companies and Job Search Status\n*Resources\n*Online Presence, Portfolio and Contact\n*Updates\n\n\n*\n\n*1. HOW DID I GET HERE?\n\nMy background until early 2020 was not coding. Other than building my old blogs with HTML\u002FCSS, for the past +10 years I’ve been building companies and\u002For leading small teams in different parts of the world but always from the “people” side of business (e.g: direct B2C\u002FB2B\u002FB2G sales, tons of speaking and teaching worldwide and\u002For remote, wrote a short book on building systems for personal productivity, etc.).\n\nHowever, I was ALWAYS interested in coding, even attempting to learn (and failing) a few times with Codecademy and such… I was interested because, like entrepreneurship, it’s another field with lower-than-average politics and clearer-than-average rules for quality and success (as Paul Graham would say, it’s where “gaming the system stops working”)… The challenge for me was that cracking the conceptual barrier of coding simply had a time opportunity cost that made it incompatible with my obligations.\n\nEnter Covid-19.\n\nOnce I realized the magnitude of the events, I decided to take 2020 as a sabbatical, focus on health and relationships, and let my curiosity guide me to my next step…. Which eventually was to go through a YC-backed coding bootcamp founded by my good friend and top-level entrepreneur Martin (he was the first Argentinian participant in my old entrepreneurship school in Chile and the person responsible to bring Paypal to Argentina, so I trusted his passion for his mission).\n\nA little while after completing the bootcamp and an internship at another YC-backed startup, I had a conversation with tech veteran David, who asked me a key question:\n\n*“Do you want to have a great career as a developer? Or did you learn just for the sake of doing something new?”\n\nAt the time, I had no idea. I had recently finished the program so I didn’t have enough time yet to take full ownership of my exploration and learning.\n\nBut now I know: I love this stuff. I love the vastness, and how hard it often feels. I love how “real” and no-BS coding is. Since then, I’ve been pouring myself 100% into this world, reading and asking people to make sure I learn the right things the right way (since it seems like you can be a developer that doesn’t really understand why things work the way they do…. I don’t want to be that guy). I’m excited to focus on becoming a very good developer for the foreseeable future.\n\n*\n\n*2. THE VISION\n\nI’ve always considered myself a “hacker”; I like to break things apart and see how I can improve them, and it encompasses my entrepreneurial identity (both as a founder and as an employee), and my newfound love for coding. Therefore, my long term vision is to become a better, healthier and happier hacker.\n\nWhat do I mean by better? \nI want to know how to do things the best way possible, because it brings the best results and pride in one’s work.\n\nWhat do I mean by healthier? \nI want to be able to do more things, because options and flexibility bring resilience and adaptability.\n\nWhat do I mean by happier? \nI want to enjoy what I do, because it means I’m living my life to the fullest.\n\nFor the sake of coding-specificity, my vision “proxy” is to reach Senior-level skill and understanding of Software Engineering.\n\nI believe this goal will get me closer to all of the above:\n*It will mean I’ve improved as a coder to the point I do things much better than I do them now, at a grander scale and scope.\n*It will mean that I can have more ideas about what could be done and a notion of how to make them a reality.\n*It will mean that my proficiency allows me to be more creative and playful, which will embed my day with more moments of “flow.”\n\nI will keep pushing towards this goal of seniority-level of mastery for as long as it takes, since the rewards of such mastery are so exciting. That is also the whole point of this document: to guide me on how to get there!\n\nIt’s important to clarify that, while I can see myself starting a new company in the future,  I currently don’t have (in the words of my friend Stepan) a “burning” vision, idea or desire that I NEED to execute. I’m much more excited about  joining a rocket-ship where I can grow and bond like crazy with other super smart tech-oriented people for the next few years! \n\nFinally, while I’m also hoping that my previous skillset (sales, speaking, managing small teams, etc.) and business experience will be complementary to my coder journey, I’m 100% fine with “shelving” that kind of work and assuming a rookie mentality and attitude for as long as it takes 🙂 \n\n*\n\n*3. THE MISSION\n\nFollowing are the multiple results I expect to achieve from this journey, and that I consider will bring me closer to my vision.\n\n#1 - Grow in Current or Different Job\n\nAfter talking with multiple veteran programmers I know (thanks to Ben, Evan, Stepan, Zac, Lucas, Caleb, David and Charly), I’m convinced that I need to continue working for good companies as a developer to grow in both skillset and responsibilities: I need to be exposed to a variety of best practices, continue to get valuable feedback, and be challenged to build larger things than what I could imagine alone… Which is why I need to be part of teams with smart colleagues and leaders that push me forward.\n\nTo be the kind of employee and team member that companies will actually want to hire, I researched what companies actually expect to see so I could further develop these mindsets and attitudes. While some of these are relevant for any profession (and I want to believe I embody already), some are coder-specific and I will use them to guide my journey:\n\n*Driven by solving user and company needs above all.\n*Collaborate with peers and mentors to complete projects as a team.\n*Show proactive curiosity to spot problems\u002Fopportunities and patterns.\n*Aim for code quality, while remaining aware of tech-debt.\n*Measure performance to spot discover potential improvements.\n*Test features, monitor releases, and mitigate risk.\n*Maintain integrity of data.\n*Complete tasks with speed, resourcefulness, and high standards.\n*Create components and scripts that save time and money.\n*Help company’s SOPs by contributing to internal processes and documentation.\n*Show ownership, autonomy, discipline, and accountability to allow for stress-free management.\n*Obsessed with candid feedback and iterations of code and personal development.\n*Ability to navigate the codebase, debug, research, and\u002For reach out to peers and mentors with clear questions.\n*Be permeable to practices and technologies from a shared environment.\n*Develop comfort communicating project statuses, making estimates, and breaking tasks into smaller chunks.\n*Honor commitments to the team and company.\n*Can learn new technologies and tools quickly.\n*Communicate effectively and adapt to the goal of the conversation (code review, performance review, brainstorming, daily standup, etc.).\n \n#2 - Pursue Craftsmanship Effectively & Efficiently\n\nThis may seem redundant, but my journey shouldn’t just bring career growth, but actually make me good at coding. From what I’ve gathered so far, coding is like any skill in the sense that quantity of hours doing something doesn’t always directly lead to improvement; we can do the same thing over and over, find a comfort zone, and not grow. In fact, we can even learn the wrong things that can slow us down and will have to “unlearn” later. \n\nIt’s not a given that our learning path will be effective and efficient, nor is it obvious how to make it so. This is probably one of the reasons many veteran programmers don’t achieve seniority from a skill and scope perspective, but rather just as a job title, and why they may still show important knowledge gaps and make foundational mistakes.\n\nOne challenge is that there’s often conflicting voices and interests on what’s the right thing to learn, and how to do it best. Listening from many sources and curating what makes more sense for my own situation is part of the game.\n\nThe goal is to try to learn as fast as possible but without cutting corners or sacrificing effectiveness. To do this, I will embed this journey with deliberate learning and practice, in a job when possible (I’m aware that one is hired first and foremost to deliver results, and that learning is a byproduct), but always on my own time at least.\n\n#3 - Have More Ideas\n\nWith a growing skill, I expect to develop a new lens through which to see the world, and perceive more business and professional opportunities. Being part of a new industry, connecting with more smart and motivated people, seeing and learning from what inspires others… I expect to have many new ideas or support other people’s exciting ideas!\n\n#4 - Feel More Flow & Happiness\n\nThanks to deep diving into a field that demands as much attention as software engineering, I hope to spend more time in a state of “flow”. In fact, since I started this journey I already noticed a big jump in the time I spend fully present in the task or challenge at hand. For me, time in state of flow is one of the two keys to happiness (freedom being the other). Coding has already made me happier, and the happier I am, the more I will want to work on it.\n\n#5 - Grow Relationships & Alliances\n\nMaybe the most important result of this journey, at least in the long term, is the new relationships in my life. Whether we become colleagues, friends or allies, expanding and diversifying the tribe of “hackers” I have been surrounding myself with my whole adult life is crazy exciting! I’m hoping to form new bonds with people that teach me and inspire me, and that I can also support in return. Here’s to us growing together for a very long time. 🙂 \n\n*\n\n*THE APPROACH\n\nTo accomplish my goals, I’ll be following the daily routine below (until I join a company, and then the job will become the priority). You can see my daily progress in My Daily Journal.\n\nWhile being employed, I’ll be making time to study, practice and journal as often as possible, but most time spent building will occur within the job (unless a new fun and inspiring idea\u002Fproject comes to mind!).\n\n#1 Study \n\nTime spent daily: ~60 mins.\nDescription: Read and watch content to learn\u002Freview fundamentals, concepts, theory, and to explore and get familiar with different tools and methodologies.\n\n#2 - Practice \n\nTime spent daily: ~60 mins.\nDescription: Go through coding exercises in books and websites.\n\n#3 - Build \n\nTime spent daily: ~120 mins.\nDescription: Code real projects that are some combination of portfolio-worthy, fun and challenging coding-wise, and (if possible) useful outside pure practice!\n\n#4 - Emails\u002FCalls \n\nTime spent: ~30 mins daily (if\u002Fwhile interviewing), ~120 mins weekly (if networking).\nDescription: Discuss progress and questions with friends, allies and mentors, reach out to relevant people, go through interviews, etc., and update Companies & Job Progress.\n\n#5 - Journal \n\nTime spent daily: ~10 mins.\nDescription: Journal what I did that day, and update Learning, Practice and Credentials Progress.\n\n*\n\n*LEARNING, PRACTICE and CREDENTIALS’ PROGRESS\n\nBelow are the multiple targets I’m working towards in parallel. This list will evolve as I learn what’s missing, what’s more or less important, or what becomes unnecessary for my personal journey.\n\n#1 - Learning\n\n*Fundamentals and Programming Concepts\n*Data Structures\n*Algorithms\n*Design Patterns\n*Object-Oriented Programming vs. Functional Programming vs. Procedural Programming\n*Test-Driven Development (TDD)\n*Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)\n*SOLID Principles\n*Backend Development\n*Servers\n*Databases\n*System Architecture\n*Microservices Architecture\n*Serverless Architecture\n*Web communication APIs (Web Service and Web Socket)\n*REST framework and RESTful services\u002FAPIs vs. GraphQL\n*Working with third-party APIs\n*Authentication and Authorization\n*Caching\n*Performance Optimization\n*Message Queues and Event Streaming\n*Microservices Orchestration\n*Security\n*Prometheus\n*Kafka\n*PHP\n*NestJS\n*Astro\n*Spring\n*Laravel\n*Express\n*Django\n*Rust\n*Python\n*Frontend Development\n*JavaScript\n*TypeScript\n*HTML\u002FCSS\n*Sass\n*React\n*Vue\n*Angular\n*Frontend libraries (Bootstrap, MaterialUI, Tailwind, Vuetify, etc.)\n*Lifecycle of Components\n*UI\u002FUX\n*Event-Based Interactions\n*Frontend Testing and Quality Assurance\n*WebSockets\n*Single-Page Applications (SPA)\n*Codepen\u002FCoderpad\n*Lodash\n*React Router\n*Chakra UI\n*Storybook for React\n*Databases and Storage\n*SQL\n*NoSQL\n*MongoDB\n*PostgreSQL\n*Redis\n*Elasticsearch\n*Snowflake\n*Neo4j\n*API Design and Development\n*GraphQL\n*Apollo\n*RESTful APIs\n*Testing and Quality Assurance\n*Unit Testing\n*Testing frameworks (Jest, Nightwatch, Testcafe)\n*End-to-End Testing\n*DevOps and Deployment\n*Git and Version Control\n*Docker\n*Kubernetes\n*Continuous Integration\u002FContinuous Deployment (CI\u002FCD)\n*Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\n*Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)\n*Deployment Strategies\n*Error Monitoring and Logging\n*Performance Monitoring\n*Security Monitoring\n*Logging Solutions\n*Jenkins\n*Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\n*TensorFlow\n*Deep Learning\n*Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n*Natural Language Understanding (NLU)\n*Neural Networks\n*RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks)\n*seq2seq (Sequence-to-Sequence)\n \n#2 - Practice\n \n*Read chapters I-X  of CTCI\n*Read all EPI\n*Solve all problems in CTCI in: Strings\u002FArrays, Linked Lists, Stacks\u002FQueues, Trees\u002FGraphs, Bit Manipulation, Math and Logic, Object-Oriented design, Recursion and Dynamic Programming, System Design and Scalability, Sorting and Searching, Testing, Databases, Threads and Locks, Moderate, Hard. \n*Solve all problems in EPI in: Strings, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks\u002FQueues, Heaps, Trees, Hash Tables, Searching, Sorting, Recursion.\n*Solve min. 5 exercises on LeetCode in under 30 min. (or it doesn't count): Merge Intervals, Meeting Rooms, Number of Islands, Spiral Matrix, Coin Change, Parse Lisp Expression, Implement LRU Cache, Text Justification, Wildcard Matching, Minimum Window Substring, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Graphs, Bitwise Operators.\n*Create an \"UI buffet\" SPA that showcases: Tic-Tac-Toe, Trello Board (create boards, create\u002Fedit\u002Fmove cards, drag and drop), Credit Card Input (spaces after every 4th digit), Event Emitter (all subscribe\u002Funsubscribe calls should be O(1)), Popover Component.\n*Complete mock interviews: Two (2) Pramp at Jr. level, two Pramp at Ssr. level, Two Interviewing.io at Jr. level, two Interviewing.io at Ssr. level.\n\n#3 - Support\n\n*If not working, build new projects consistently\n*Update Github repos' Readme files of new projects\n*Ask veteran programmers and mentors for feedback on my journey\n*Apply to 20 companies\u002Fjobs per batch to get, at least, practice with new technical challenges.\n*After getting a new job:\n*Edit and publish public version of journal to help others interested in taking a similar approach\n*Send “State of Affairs” email to close network\n*Thank everyone involved in this journey with me!\n\n*\n\n*COMPANIES and JOB PROGRESS\n\nIn this section I’ll share the conditions for the kind of job I’m hoping to find, the companies that have grabbed my attention so far (even if they are not hiring at the moment), and the overall status of my job search.\n\nThe most important conditions are: \n*Full stack role.\n*Small\u002FMid size company.\n*Real opportunity to help the team and deliver results, but also be challenged and learn.\n*Inspiring and knowledgeable leadership.\n*Smart and good-hearted colleagues.\n*Tight development team.\n*Remote and healthy company culture.\n*North America or Europe based.\n*English-speaking.\n\nAs a bonus, I’d strongly prefer a company that doesn’t discriminate salary based on the employee’s location, because a) I don’t agree with the principle of it, b) it prevents me from being evaluated (and pushed forward) completely by my skill\u002Fresults\u002Fpotential instead of by the company’s need for cheap labor, c) I live a “digital nomad” lifestyle and tend to relocate often (already lived in countries like Australia, Chile and Estonia), and I don’t want to be forever conditioned because of where I was living at the time of joining.\n\nI’m obviously willing to earn less net because of any extra legal burden\u002Fcost for the company if that’s the case (e.g.: company needs to hire me as a contractor instead of an employee and can’t pay for health insurance) but gross would ideally be whatever the company would pay someone in its country for the same remote role. If this requirement ends up being impossible to meet, then I’ll adapt, but I’ll be looking very hard for companies with this mindset and culture (which I know exist!).\n\nDo you have any in mind? 🙂 \n\nUpdate (Aug 9th, 2021): After some great conversations with my friends Ian, Stepan and Caleb, I’ve decided to refine my outreach strategy to potential companies:\n*Research batches of ~20 great companies to reach out to at the same time, and try to go through their recruiting process in parallel.\n*Diversify the companies in each batch: 100% startups (\u003C50 employees), 20% mid-size potential pre-IPO companies (200-500 employees), and 20% blockchain\u002Fcrypto startups.\n*Will test this A-B-C testing for a couple of batches and see what the response is.\n*After a couple of weeks, restart the process with a new batch regardless of the status with companies from previous batches.\n*Continue until officially hired.\n \nPotential for upcoming batches: Porter (S), EightSleep (S), Boost (S), UpFlow (S), Quest (S),  Debrief (S), Slope (S), Ashby (S), Govalo (S)\n\nPre-Network Research Batch (before August 2021): Testlio, Close, Tame, Designstripe, Vincit,  MeetEdgar, Boundless, Comodule, Assemble, Elastic\n\nInitial batch July 2023: MedMe (S), Whimsical (S), Timeular (S), Pave (S), Airtable (M), BetterCloud (M), Calendly (M), Calm (M), Coalition (M), Digit (M),

In case we don’t know each other but you still found or got sent this document, my name is Carlos (pleased to meet you!). This document aims to achieve a number of goals:\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOutline a personalized and intense learning plan towards my (relative) mastery of coding. It should be rich in deliberate practice and feedback, and adapt according to my growth and my mentors’ opinions.\xa0\n\u200b\u200bJournal my progress to spot opportunities for improvement.\n\u200b\u200bIf you feel inclined to help me, this should make it easier for you to know how (or make it easier to pass along to people you think can help).\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b(Thanks to my friend and mentor Stepan for his recommendation to put this together!)\n\u200b\n\u200bTL;DR CARLOS’ STATUS\n\u200b\u200bCurrently at Semi-Sr. level, and looking for a new position as a full-stack developer after 2 years working for a small tech company based in Austin, TX.\n\u200b\u200bInterested in solving a variety of new technical challenges that expose me to more problems, approaches and philosophies in programming.\n\u200b\u200bStudying, practicing and building projects consistently to get really good at software engineering (see The Mission, The Approach, Resources).\n\u200b\u200bHere is my website, Github (past 2 years of commits are private in my former employer’s profile), Linkedin and email.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bOUTLINE\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bHow Did I Get Here?\n\u200b\u200bThe Vision\n\u200b\u200bThe Mission\n\u200b\u200bGrow in Current or Different Job\n\u200b\u200bPursue Craftsmanship Effectively & Efficiently\n\u200b\u200bHave More Ideas\n\u200b\u200bFeel More Flow & Happiness\n\u200b\u200bGrow Relationships & Alliances\n\u200b\u200bThe Approach\n\u200b\u200bLearning, Practice and Credentials’ Progress\n\u200b\u200bCompanies and Job Search Status\n\u200b\u200bResources\n\u200b\u200bOnline Presence, Portfolio and Contact\n\u200b\u200bUpdates\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200b1. HOW DID I GET HERE?\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bMy background until early 2020 was not coding. Other than building my old blogs with HTML/CSS, for the past +10 years I’ve been building companies and/or leading small teams in different parts of the world but always from the “people” side of business (e.g: direct B2C/B2B/B2G sales, tons of speaking and teaching worldwide and/or remote, wrote a short book on building systems for personal productivity, etc.).\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bHowever, I was ALWAYS interested in coding, even attempting to learn (and failing) a few times with Codecademy and such… I was interested because, like entrepreneurship, it’s another field with lower-than-average politics and clearer-than-average rules for quality and success (as Paul Graham would say, it’s where “gaming the system stops working”)… The challenge for me was that cracking the conceptual barrier of coding simply had a time opportunity cost that made it incompatible with my obligations.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bEnter Covid-19.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOnce I realized the magnitude of the events, I decided to take 2020 as a sabbatical, focus on health and relationships, and let my curiosity guide me to my next step…. Which eventually was to go through a YC-backed coding bootcamp founded by my good friend and top-level entrepreneur Martin (he was the first Argentinian participant in my old entrepreneurship school in Chile and the person responsible to bring Paypal to Argentina, so I trusted his passion for his mission).\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bA little while after completing the bootcamp and an internship at another YC-backed startup, I had a conversation with tech veteran David, who asked me a key question:\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b“Do you want to have a great career as a developer? Or did you learn just for the sake of doing something new?”\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAt the time, I had no idea. I had recently finished the program so I didn’t have enough time yet to take full ownership of my exploration and learning.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bBut now I know: I love this stuff. I love the vastness, and how hard it often feels. I love how “real” and no-BS coding is. Since then, I’ve been pouring myself 100% into this world, reading and asking people to make sure I learn the right things the right way (since it seems like you can be a developer that doesn’t really understand why things work the way they do…. I don’t want to be that guy). I’m excited to focus on becoming a very good developer for the foreseeable future.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200b2. THE VISION\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI’ve always considered myself a “hacker”; I like to break things apart and see how I can improve them, and it encompasses my entrepreneurial identity (both as a founder and as an employee), and my newfound love for coding. Therefore, my long term vision is to become a better, healthier and happier hacker.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by better?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to know how to do things the best way possible, because it brings the best results and pride in one’s work.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by healthier?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to be able to do more things, because options and flexibility bring resilience and adaptability.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by happier?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to enjoy what I do, because it means I’m living my life to the fullest.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFor the sake of coding-specificity, my vision “proxy” is to reach Senior-level skill and understanding of Software Engineering.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI believe this goal will get me closer to all of the above:\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean I’ve improved as a coder to the point I do things much better than I do them now, at a grander scale and scope.\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean that I can have more ideas about what could be done and a notion of how to make them a reality.\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean that my proficiency allows me to be more creative and playful, which will embed my day with more moments of “flow.”\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI will keep pushing towards this goal of seniority-level of mastery for as long as it takes, since the rewards of such mastery are so exciting. That is also the whole point of this document: to guide me on how to get there!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIt’s important to clarify that, while I can see myself starting a new company in the future, \xa0I currently don’t have (in the words of my friend Stepan) a “burning” vision, idea or desire that I NEED to execute. I’m much more excited about \xa0joining a rocket-ship where I can grow and bond like crazy with other super smart tech-oriented people for the next few years!\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFinally, while I’m also hoping that my previous skillset (sales, speaking, managing small teams, etc.) and business experience will be complementary to my coder journey, I’m 100% fine with “shelving” that kind of work and assuming a rookie mentality and attitude for as long as it takes \u200b🙂\u200b\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200b3. THE MISSION\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFollowing are the multiple results I expect to achieve from this journey, and that I consider will bring me closer to my vision.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#1 - Grow in Current or Different Job\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAfter talking with multiple veteran programmers I know (thanks to Ben, Evan, Stepan, Zac, Lucas, Caleb, David and Charly), I’m convinced that I need to continue working for good companies as a developer to grow in both skillset and responsibilities: I need to be exposed to a variety of best practices, continue to get valuable feedback, and be challenged to build larger things than what I could imagine alone… Which is why I need to be part of teams with smart colleagues and leaders that push me forward.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bTo be the kind of employee and team member that companies will actually want to hire, I researched what companies actually expect to see so I could further develop these mindsets and attitudes. While some of these are relevant for any profession (and I want to believe I embody already), some are coder-specific and I will use them to guide my journey:\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bDriven by solving user and company needs above all.\n\u200b\u200bCollaborate with peers and mentors to complete projects as a team.\n\u200b\u200bShow proactive curiosity to spot problems/opportunities and patterns.\n\u200b\u200bAim for code quality, while remaining aware of tech-debt.\n\u200b\u200bMeasure performance to spot discover potential improvements.\n\u200b\u200bTest features, monitor releases, and mitigate risk.\n\u200b\u200bMaintain integrity of data.\n\u200b\u200bComplete tasks with speed, resourcefulness, and high standards.\n\u200b\u200bCreate components and scripts that save time and money.\n\u200b\u200bHelp company’s SOPs by contributing to internal processes and documentation.\n\u200b\u200bShow ownership, autonomy, discipline, and accountability to allow for stress-free management.\n\u200b\u200bObsessed with candid feedback and iterations of code and personal development.\n\u200b\u200bAbility to navigate the codebase, debug, research, and/or reach out to peers and mentors with clear questions.\n\u200b\u200bBe permeable to practices and technologies from a shared environment.\n\u200b\u200bDevelop comfort communicating project statuses, making estimates, and breaking tasks into smaller chunks.\n\u200b\u200bHonor commitments to the team and company.\n\u200b\u200bCan learn new technologies and tools quickly.\n\u200b\u200bCommunicate effectively and adapt to the goal of the conversation (code review, performance review, brainstorming, daily standup, etc.).\n\u200b\u200b\xa0\n\u200b\u200b#2 - Pursue Craftsmanship Effectively & Efficiently\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThis may seem redundant, but my journey shouldn’t just bring career growth, but actually make me good at coding. From what I’ve gathered so far, coding is like any skill in the sense that quantity of hours doing something doesn’t always directly lead to improvement; we can do the same thing over and over, find a comfort zone, and not grow. In fact, we can even learn the wrong things that can slow us down and will have to “unlearn” later.\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIt’s not a given that our learning path will be effective and efficient, nor is it obvious how to make it so. This is probably one of the reasons many veteran programmers don’t achieve seniority from a skill and scope perspective, but rather just as a job title, and why they may still show important knowledge gaps and make foundational mistakes.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOne challenge is that there’s often conflicting voices and interests on what’s the right thing to learn, and how to do it best. Listening from many sources and curating what makes more sense for my own situation is part of the game.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThe goal is to try to learn as fast as possible but without cutting corners or sacrificing effectiveness. To do this, I will embed this journey with deliberate learning and practice, in a job when possible (I’m aware that one is hired first and foremost to deliver results, and that learning is a byproduct), but always on my own time at least.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#3 - Have More Ideas\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bWith a growing skill, I expect to develop a new lens through which to see the world, and perceive more business and professional opportunities. Being part of a new industry, connecting with more smart and motivated people, seeing and learning from what inspires others… I expect to have many new ideas or support other people’s exciting ideas!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#4 - Feel More Flow & Happiness\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThanks to deep diving into a field that demands as much attention as software engineering, I hope to spend more time in a state of “flow”. In fact, since I started this journey I already noticed a big jump in the time I spend fully present in the task or challenge at hand. For me, time in state of flow is one of the two keys to happiness (freedom being the other). Coding has already made me happier, and the happier I am, the more I will want to work on it.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#5 - Grow Relationships & Alliances\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bMaybe the most important result of this journey, at least in the long term, is the new relationships in my life. Whether we become colleagues, friends or allies, expanding and diversifying the tribe of “hackers” I have been surrounding myself with my whole adult life is crazy exciting!

HOW DID I GET HERE?\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bMy background until early 2020 was not coding. Other than building my old blogs with HTML/CSS, for the past +10 years I’ve been building companies and/or leading small teams in different parts of the world but always from the “people” side of business (e.g: direct B2C/B2B/B2G sales, tons of speaking and teaching worldwide and/or remote, wrote a short book on building systems for personal productivity, etc.).\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bHowever, I was ALWAYS interested in coding, even attempting to learn (and failing) a few times with Codecademy and such… I was interested because, like entrepreneurship, it’s another field with lower-than-average politics and clearer-than-average rules for quality and success (as Paul Graham would say, it’s where “gaming the system stops working”)… The challenge for me was that cracking the conceptual barrier of coding simply had a time opportunity cost that made it incompatible with my obligations.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bEnter Covid-19.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOnce I realized the magnitude of the events, I decided to take 2020 as a sabbatical, focus on health and relationships, and let my curiosity guide me to my next step…. Which eventually was to go through a YC-backed coding bootcamp founded by my good friend and top-level entrepreneur Martin (he was the first Argentinian participant in my old entrepreneurship school in Chile and the person responsible to bring Paypal to Argentina, so I trusted his passion for his mission).\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bA little while after completing the bootcamp and an internship at another YC-backed startup, I had a conversation with tech veteran David, who asked me a key question:\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b“Do you want to have a great career as a developer? Or did you learn just for the sake of doing something new?”\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAt the time, I had no idea. I had recently finished the program so I didn’t have enough time yet to take full ownership of my exploration and learning.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bBut now I know: I love this stuff. I love the vastness, and how hard it often feels. I love how “real” and no-BS coding is. Since then, I’ve been pouring myself 100% into this world, reading and asking people to make sure I learn the right things the right way (since it seems like you can be a developer that doesn’t really understand why things work the way they do…. I don’t want to be that guy). I’m excited to focus on becoming a very good developer for the foreseeable future.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200b2. THE VISION\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI’ve always considered myself a “hacker”; I like to break things apart and see how I can improve them, and it encompasses my entrepreneurial identity (both as a founder and as an employee), and my newfound love for coding. Therefore, my long term vision is to become a better, healthier and happier hacker.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by better?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to know how to do things the best way possible, because it brings the best results and pride in one’s work.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by healthier?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to be able to do more things, because options and flexibility bring resilience and adaptability.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by happier?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to enjoy what I do, because it means I’m living my life to the fullest.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFor the sake of coding-specificity, my vision “proxy” is to reach Senior-level skill and understanding of Software Engineering.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI believe this goal will get me closer to all of the above:\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean I’ve improved as a coder to the point I do things much better than I do them now, at a grander scale and scope.\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean that I can have more ideas about what could be done and a notion of how to make them a reality.\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean that my proficiency allows me to be more creative and playful, which will embed my day with more moments of “flow.”\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI will keep pushing towards this goal of seniority-level of mastery for as long as it takes, since the rewards of such mastery are so exciting. That is also the whole point of this document: to guide me on how to get there!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIt’s important to clarify that, while I can see myself starting a new company in the future, \xa0I currently don’t have (in the words of my friend Stepan) a “burning” vision, idea or desire that I NEED to execute. I’m much more excited about \xa0joining a rocket-ship where I can grow and bond like crazy with other super smart tech-oriented people for the next few years!\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFinally, while I’m also hoping that my previous skillset (sales, speaking, managing small teams, etc.) and business experience will be complementary to my coder journey, I’m 100% fine with “shelving” that kind of work and assuming a rookie mentality and attitude for as long as it takes \u200b🙂\u200b\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200b3. THE MISSION\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFollowing are the multiple results I expect to achieve from this journey, and that I consider will bring me closer to my vision.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#1 - Grow in Current or Different Job\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAfter talking with multiple veteran programmers I know (thanks to Ben, Evan, Stepan, Zac, Lucas, Caleb, David and Charly), I’m convinced that I need to continue working for good companies as a developer to grow in both skillset and responsibilities: I need to be exposed to a variety of best practices, continue to get valuable feedback, and be challenged to build larger things than what I could imagine alone… Which is why I need to be part of teams with smart colleagues and leaders that push me forward.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bTo be the kind of employee and team member that companies will actually want to hire, I researched what companies actually expect to see so I could further develop these mindsets and attitudes. While some of these are relevant for any profession (and I want to believe I embody already), some are coder-specific and I will use them to guide my journey:\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bDriven by solving user and company needs above all.\n\u200b\u200bCollaborate with peers and mentors to complete projects as a team.\n\u200b\u200bShow proactive curiosity to spot problems/opportunities and patterns.\n\u200b\u200bAim for code quality, while remaining aware of tech-debt.\n\u200b\u200bMeasure performance to spot discover potential improvements.\n\u200b\u200bTest features, monitor releases, and mitigate risk.\n\u200b\u200bMaintain integrity of data.\n\u200b\u200bComplete tasks with speed, resourcefulness, and high standards.\n\u200b\u200bCreate components and scripts that save time and money.\n\u200b\u200bHelp company’s SOPs by contributing to internal processes and documentation.\n\u200b\u200bShow ownership, autonomy, discipline, and accountability to allow for stress-free management.\n\u200b\u200bObsessed with candid feedback and iterations of code and personal development.\n\u200b\u200bAbility to navigate the codebase, debug, research, and/or reach out to peers and mentors with clear questions.\n\u200b\u200bBe permeable to practices and technologies from a shared environment.\n\u200b\u200bDevelop comfort communicating project statuses, making estimates, and breaking tasks into smaller chunks.\n\u200b\u200bHonor commitments to the team and company.\n\u200b\u200bCan learn new technologies and tools quickly.\n\u200b\u200bCommunicate effectively and adapt to the goal of the conversation (code review, performance review, brainstorming, daily standup, etc.).\n\u200b\u200b\xa0\n\u200b\u200b#2 - Pursue Craftsmanship Effectively & Efficiently\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThis may seem redundant, but my journey shouldn’t just bring career growth, but actually make me good at coding. From what I’ve gathered so far, coding is like any skill in the sense that quantity of hours doing something doesn’t always directly lead to improvement; we can do the same thing over and over, find a comfort zone, and not grow. In fact, we can even learn the wrong things that can slow us down and will have to “unlearn” later.\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIt’s not a given that our learning path will be effective and efficient, nor is it obvious how to make it so. This is probably one of the reasons many veteran programmers don’t achieve seniority from a skill and scope perspective, but rather just as a job title, and why they may still show important knowledge gaps and make foundational mistakes.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOne challenge is that there’s often conflicting voices and interests on what’s the right thing to learn, and how to do it best. Listening from many sources and curating what makes more sense for my own situation is part of the game.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThe goal is to try to learn as fast as possible but without cutting corners or sacrificing effectiveness. To do this, I will embed this journey with deliberate learning and practice, in a job when possible (I’m aware that one is hired first and foremost to deliver results, and that learning is a byproduct), but always on my own time at least.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#3 - Have More Ideas\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bWith a growing skill, I expect to develop a new lens through which to see the world, and perceive more business and professional opportunities. Being part of a new industry, connecting with more smart and motivated people, seeing and learning from what inspires others… I expect to have many new ideas or support other people’s exciting ideas!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#4 - Feel More Flow & Happiness\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThanks to deep diving into a field that demands as much attention as software engineering, I hope to spend more time in a state of “flow”. In fact, since I started this journey I already noticed a big jump in the time I spend fully present in the task or challenge at hand. For me, time in state of flow is one of the two keys to happiness (freedom being the other). Coding has already made me happier, and the happier I am, the more I will want to work on it.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#5 - Grow Relationships & Alliances\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bMaybe the most important result of this journey, at least in the long term, is the new relationships in my life. Whether we become colleagues, friends or allies, expanding and diversifying the tribe of “hackers” I have been surrounding myself with my whole adult life is crazy exciting! I’m hoping to form new bonds with people that teach me and inspire me, and that I can also support in return. Here’s to us growing together for a very long time. \u200b🙂\u200b\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bTHE APPROACH\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bTo accomplish my goals, I’ll be following the daily routine below (until I join a company, and then the job will become the priority).

HOW DID I GET HERE?\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bMy background until early 2020 was not coding. Other than building my old blogs with HTML/CSS, for the past +10 years I’ve been building companies and/or leading small teams in different parts of the world but always from the “people” side of business (e.g: direct B2C/B2B/B2G sales, tons of speaking and teaching worldwide and/or remote, wrote a short book on building systems for personal productivity, etc.).\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bHowever, I was ALWAYS interested in coding, even attempting to learn (and failing) a few times with Codecademy and such… I was interested because, like entrepreneurship, it’s another field with lower-than-average politics and clearer-than-average rules for quality and success (as Paul Graham would say, it’s where “gaming the system stops working”)… The challenge for me was that cracking the conceptual barrier of coding simply had a time opportunity cost that made it incompatible with my obligations.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bEnter Covid-19.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOnce I realized the magnitude of the events, I decided to take 2020 as a sabbatical, focus on health and relationships, and let my curiosity guide me to my next step…. Which eventually was to go through a YC-backed coding bootcamp founded by my good friend and top-level entrepreneur Martin (he was the first Argentinian participant in my old entrepreneurship school in Chile and the person responsible to bring Paypal to Argentina, so I trusted his passion for his mission).\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bA little while after completing the bootcamp and an internship at another YC-backed startup, I had a conversation with tech veteran David, who asked me a key question:\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b“Do you want to have a great career as a developer? Or did you learn just for the sake of doing something new?”\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAt the time, I had no idea. I had recently finished the program so I didn’t have enough time yet to take full ownership of my exploration and learning.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bBut now I know: I love this stuff. I love the vastness, and how hard it often feels. I love how “real” and no-BS coding is. Since then, I’ve been pouring myself 100% into this world, reading and asking people to make sure I learn the right things the right way (since it seems like you can be a developer that doesn’t really understand why things work the way they do…. I don’t want to be that guy). I’m excited to focus on becoming a very good developer for the foreseeable future.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200b2. THE VISION\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI’ve always considered myself a “hacker”; I like to break things apart and see how I can improve them, and it encompasses my entrepreneurial identity (both as a founder and as an employee), and my newfound love for coding. Therefore, my long term vision is to become a better, healthier and happier hacker.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by better?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to know how to do things the best way possible, because it brings the best results and pride in one’s work.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by healthier?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to be able to do more things, because options and flexibility bring resilience and adaptability.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by happier?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to enjoy what I do, because it means I’m living my life to the fullest.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFor the sake of coding-specificity, my vision “proxy” is to reach Senior-level skill and understanding of Software Engineering.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI believe this goal will get me closer to all of the above:\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean I’ve improved as a coder to the point I do things much better than I do them now, at a grander scale and scope.\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean that I can have more ideas about what could be done and a notion of how to make them a reality.\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean that my proficiency allows me to be more creative and playful, which will embed my day with more moments of “flow.”\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI will keep pushing towards this goal of seniority-level of mastery for as long as it takes, since the rewards of such mastery are so exciting. That is also the whole point of this document: to guide me on how to get there!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIt’s important to clarify that, while I can see myself starting a new company in the future, \xa0I currently don’t have (in the words of my friend Stepan) a “burning” vision, idea or desire that I NEED to execute. I’m much more excited about \xa0joining a rocket-ship where I can grow and bond like crazy with other super smart tech-oriented people for the next few years!\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFinally, while I’m also hoping that my previous skillset (sales, speaking, managing small teams, etc.) and business experience will be complementary to my coder journey, I’m 100% fine with “shelving” that kind of work and assuming a rookie mentality and attitude for as long as it takes \u200b🙂\u200b\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200b3. THE MISSION\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFollowing are the multiple results I expect to achieve from this journey, and that I consider will bring me closer to my vision.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#1 - Grow in Current or Different Job\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAfter talking with multiple veteran programmers I know (thanks to Ben, Evan, Stepan, Zac, Lucas, Caleb, David and Charly), I’m convinced that I need to continue working for good companies as a developer to grow in both skillset and responsibilities: I need to be exposed to a variety of best practices, continue to get valuable feedback, and be challenged to build larger things than what I could imagine alone… Which is why I need to be part of teams with smart colleagues and leaders that push me forward.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bTo be the kind of employee and team member that companies will actually want to hire, I researched what companies actually expect to see so I could further develop these mindsets and attitudes. While some of these are relevant for any profession (and I want to believe I embody already), some are coder-specific and I will use them to guide my journey:\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bDriven by solving user and company needs above all.\n\u200b\u200bCollaborate with peers and mentors to complete projects as a team.\n\u200b\u200bShow proactive curiosity to spot problems/opportunities and patterns.\n\u200b\u200bAim for code quality, while remaining aware of tech-debt.\n\u200b\u200bMeasure performance to spot discover potential improvements.\n\u200b\u200bTest features, monitor releases, and mitigate risk.\n\u200b\u200bMaintain integrity of data.\n\u200b\u200bComplete tasks with speed, resourcefulness, and high standards.\n\u200b\u200bCreate components and scripts that save time and money.\n\u200b\u200bHelp company’s SOPs by contributing to internal processes and documentation.\n\u200b\u200bShow ownership, autonomy, discipline, and accountability to allow for stress-free management.\n\u200b\u200bObsessed with candid feedback and iterations of code and personal development.\n\u200b\u200bAbility to navigate the codebase, debug, research, and/or reach out to peers and mentors with clear questions.\n\u200b\u200bBe permeable to practices and technologies from a shared environment.\n\u200b\u200bDevelop comfort communicating project statuses, making estimates, and breaking tasks into smaller chunks.\n\u200b\u200bHonor commitments to the team and company.\n\u200b\u200bCan learn new technologies and tools quickly.\n\u200b\u200bCommunicate effectively and adapt to the goal of the conversation (code review, performance review, brainstorming, daily standup, etc.).\n\u200b\u200b\xa0\n\u200b\u200b#2 - Pursue Craftsmanship Effectively & Efficiently\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThis may seem redundant, but my journey shouldn’t just bring career growth, but actually make me good at coding. From what I’ve gathered so far, coding is like any skill in the sense that quantity of hours doing something doesn’t always directly lead to improvement; we can do the same thing over and over, find a comfort zone, and not grow. In fact, we can even learn the wrong things that can slow us down and will have to “unlearn” later.\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIt’s not a given that our learning path will be effective and efficient, nor is it obvious how to make it so. This is probably one of the reasons many veteran programmers don’t achieve seniority from a skill and scope perspective, but rather just as a job title, and why they may still show important knowledge gaps and make foundational mistakes.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOne challenge is that there’s often conflicting voices and interests on what’s the right thing to learn, and how to do it best. Listening from many sources and curating what makes more sense for my own situation is part of the game.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThe goal is to try to learn as fast as possible but without cutting corners or sacrificing effectiveness. To do this, I will embed this journey with deliberate learning and practice, in a job when possible (I’m aware that one is hired first and foremost to deliver results, and that learning is a byproduct), but always on my own time at least.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#3 - Have More Ideas\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bWith a growing skill, I expect to develop a new lens through which to see the world, and perceive more business and professional opportunities. Being part of a new industry, connecting with more smart and motivated people, seeing and learning from what inspires others… I expect to have many new ideas or support other people’s exciting ideas!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#4 - Feel More Flow & Happiness\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThanks to deep diving into a field that demands as much attention as software engineering, I hope to spend more time in a state of “flow”. In fact, since I started this journey I already noticed a big jump in the time I spend fully present in the task or challenge at hand. For me, time in state of flow is one of the two keys to happiness (freedom being the other). Coding has already made me happier, and the happier I am, the more I will want to work on it.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#5 - Grow Relationships & Alliances\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bMaybe the most important result of this journey, at least in the long term, is the new relationships in my life. Whether we become colleagues, friends or allies, expanding and diversifying the tribe of “hackers” I have been surrounding myself with my whole adult life is crazy exciting! I’m hoping to form new bonds with people that teach me and inspire me, and that I can also support in return. Here’s to us growing together for a very long time. \u200b🙂\u200b\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bTHE APPROACH\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bTo accomplish my goals, I’ll be following the daily routine below (until I join a company, and then the job will become the priority).

HOW DID I GET HERE?\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bMy background until early 2020 was not coding. Other than building my old blogs with HTML/CSS, for the past +10 years I’ve been building companies and/or leading small teams in different parts of the world but always from the “people” side of business (e.g: direct B2C/B2B/B2G sales, tons of speaking and teaching worldwide and/or remote, wrote a short book on building systems for personal productivity, etc.).\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bHowever, I was ALWAYS interested in coding, even attempting to learn (and failing) a few times with Codecademy and such… I was interested because, like entrepreneurship, it’s another field with lower-than-average politics and clearer-than-average rules for quality and success (as Paul Graham would say, it’s where “gaming the system stops working”)… The challenge for me was that cracking the conceptual barrier of coding simply had a time opportunity cost that made it incompatible with my obligations.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bEnter Covid-19.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOnce I realized the magnitude of the events, I decided to take 2020 as a sabbatical, focus on health and relationships, and let my curiosity guide me to my next step…. Which eventually was to go through a YC-backed coding bootcamp founded by my good friend and top-level entrepreneur Martin (he was the first Argentinian participant in my old entrepreneurship school in Chile and the person responsible to bring Paypal to Argentina, so I trusted his passion for his mission).\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bA little while after completing the bootcamp and an internship at another YC-backed startup, I had a conversation with tech veteran David, who asked me a key question:\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b“Do you want to have a great career as a developer? Or did you learn just for the sake of doing something new?”\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAt the time, I had no idea. I had recently finished the program so I didn’t have enough time yet to take full ownership of my exploration and learning.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bBut now I know: I love this stuff. I love the vastness, and how hard it often feels. I love how “real” and no-BS coding is. Since then, I’ve been pouring myself 100% into this world, reading and asking people to make sure I learn the right things the right way (since it seems like you can be a developer that doesn’t really understand why things work the way they do…. I don’t want to be that guy). I’m excited to focus on becoming a very good developer for the foreseeable future.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200b2. THE VISION\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI’ve always considered myself a “hacker”; I like to break things apart and see how I can improve them, and it encompasses my entrepreneurial identity (both as a founder and as an employee), and my newfound love for coding. Therefore, my long term vision is to become a better, healthier and happier hacker.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by better?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to know how to do things the best way possible, because it brings the best results and pride in one’s work.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by healthier?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to be able to do more things, because options and flexibility bring resilience and adaptability.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200bWhat do I mean by happier?\xa0\n\u200b\u200bI want to enjoy what I do, because it means I’m living my life to the fullest.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFor the sake of coding-specificity, my vision “proxy” is to reach Senior-level skill and understanding of Software Engineering.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI believe this goal will get me closer to all of the above:\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean I’ve improved as a coder to the point I do things much better than I do them now, at a grander scale and scope.\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean that I can have more ideas about what could be done and a notion of how to make them a reality.\n\u200b\u200bIt will mean that my proficiency allows me to be more creative and playful, which will embed my day with more moments of “flow.”\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bI will keep pushing towards this goal of seniority-level of mastery for as long as it takes, since the rewards of such mastery are so exciting. That is also the whole point of this document: to guide me on how to get there!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIt’s important to clarify that, while I can see myself starting a new company in the future, \xa0I currently don’t have (in the words of my friend Stepan) a “burning” vision, idea or desire that I NEED to execute. I’m much more excited about \xa0joining a rocket-ship where I can grow and bond like crazy with other super smart tech-oriented people for the next few years!\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFinally, while I’m also hoping that my previous skillset (sales, speaking, managing small teams, etc.) and business experience will be complementary to my coder journey, I’m 100% fine with “shelving” that kind of work and assuming a rookie mentality and attitude for as long as it takes \u200b🙂\u200b\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\u200b3. THE MISSION\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFollowing are the multiple results I expect to achieve from this journey, and that I consider will bring me closer to my vision.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#1 - Grow in Current or Different Job\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAfter talking with multiple veteran programmers I know (thanks to Ben, Evan, Stepan, Zac, Lucas, Caleb, David and Charly), I’m convinced that I need to continue working for good companies as a developer to grow in both skillset and responsibilities: I need to be exposed to a variety of best practices, continue to get valuable feedback, and be challenged to build larger things than what I could imagine alone… Which is why I need to be part of teams with smart colleagues and leaders that push me forward.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bTo be the kind of employee and team member that companies will actually want to hire, I researched what companies actually expect to see so I could further develop these mindsets and attitudes. While some of these are relevant for any profession (and I want to believe I embody already), some are coder-specific and I will use them to guide my journey:\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bDriven by solving user and company needs above all.\n\u200b\u200bCollaborate with peers and mentors to complete projects as a team.\n\u200b\u200bShow proactive curiosity to spot problems/opportunities and patterns.\n\u200b\u200bAim for code quality, while remaining aware of tech-debt.\n\u200b\u200bMeasure performance to spot discover potential improvements.\n\u200b\u200bTest features, monitor releases, and mitigate risk.\n\u200b\u200bMaintain integrity of data.\n\u200b\u200bComplete tasks with speed, resourcefulness, and high standards.\n\u200b\u200bCreate components and scripts that save time and money.\n\u200b\u200bHelp company’s SOPs by contributing to internal processes and documentation.\n\u200b\u200bShow ownership, autonomy, discipline, and accountability to allow for stress-free management.\n\u200b\u200bObsessed with candid feedback and iterations of code and personal development.\n\u200b\u200bAbility to navigate the codebase, debug, research, and/or reach out to peers and mentors with clear questions.\n\u200b\u200bBe permeable to practices and technologies from a shared environment.\n\u200b\u200bDevelop comfort communicating project statuses, making estimates, and breaking tasks into smaller chunks.\n\u200b\u200bHonor commitments to the team and company.\n\u200b\u200bCan learn new technologies and tools quickly.\n\u200b\u200bCommunicate effectively and adapt to the goal of the conversation (code review, performance review, brainstorming, daily standup, etc.).\n\u200b\u200b\xa0\n\u200b\u200b#2 - Pursue Craftsmanship Effectively & Efficiently\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThis may seem redundant, but my journey shouldn’t just bring career growth, but actually make me good at coding. From what I’ve gathered so far, coding is like any skill in the sense that quantity of hours doing something doesn’t always directly lead to improvement; we can do the same thing over and over, find a comfort zone, and not grow. In fact, we can even learn the wrong things that can slow us down and will have to “unlearn” later.\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIt’s not a given that our learning path will be effective and efficient, nor is it obvious how to make it so. This is probably one of the reasons many veteran programmers don’t achieve seniority from a skill and scope perspective, but rather just as a job title, and why they may still show important knowledge gaps and make foundational mistakes.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOne challenge is that there’s often conflicting voices and interests on what’s the right thing to learn, and how to do it best. Listening from many sources and curating what makes more sense for my own situation is part of the game.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThe goal is to try to learn as fast as possible but without cutting corners or sacrificing effectiveness. To do this, I will embed this journey with deliberate learning and practice, in a job when possible (I’m aware that one is hired first and foremost to deliver results, and that learning is a byproduct), but always on my own time at least.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#3 - Have More Ideas\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bWith a growing skill, I expect to develop a new lens through which to see the world, and perceive more business and professional opportunities. Being part of a new industry, connecting with more smart and motivated people, seeing and learning from what inspires others… I expect to have many new ideas or support other people’s exciting ideas!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#4 - Feel More Flow & Happiness\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThanks to deep diving into a field that demands as much attention as software engineering, I hope to spend more time in a state of “flow”. In fact, since I started this journey I already noticed a big jump in the time I spend fully present in the task or challenge at hand. For me, time in state of flow is one of the two keys to happiness (freedom being the other). Coding has already made me happier, and the happier I am, the more I will want to work on it.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b#5 - Grow Relationships & Alliances\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bMaybe the most important result of this journey, at least in the long term, is the new relationships in my life. Whether we become colleagues, friends or allies, expanding and diversifying the tribe of “hackers” I have been surrounding myself with my whole adult life is crazy exciting! I’m hoping to form new bonds with people that teach me and inspire me, and that I can also support in return.
